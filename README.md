# monopoly
Simulation that throw dice and move around a Monopoly board. No other game dinamics involved. This was just made to calculate the <i>proprerties</i> where is more probable to land.<br>
There are two versions of the game implemented: Default and "Città d'Italia". They differ both in displacement of <i>properties</i> along the board and the <i>Imprevisti</i> and <i>Probabilità</i> decks.
